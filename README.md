# StaticHTMLBuilder
This project is a very crude html builder. </br>
The purpose is to take an excel document, take each row and put them into a static html page. </br>
Because of it's plainness, this code will at best be used for reference. This is coded for a very specific case and at this time there is no plan to abstract for flexiblity.
